v1.1.1 - General Stability Fixes - 07/19/2012

- HUD now shows up quickly on the Camera and Camera Roll without needless delay
- FPPicker now retains the delegate. This is to prevent crashing. While still being able to call back to the delegate may not be proper behavior, it doesn't crash. Async uploads, coming soon, will handle this better.

- Namespacing. All external libraries, AFNetworking, JSONKit, MBProgressHUD and PullRefreshTable are now prefixed with 'FP' to prevent the duplicate symbol definition bug
